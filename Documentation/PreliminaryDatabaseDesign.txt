1.1 – Project description, database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff.

    This database is intended to provide information on guns and gun owners.  With this
    database, a user can find information as general as gun companies, to information as specific
    as the gun serial numbers.  The database also provides a way to link specific guns
    to their owners.  Therefore, this database can be used for more than a single purpose.

    Database Engine: Postgres

    Potential Users: Police, Gun Enthusiasts, Military
