Detailed Database Design


2.1 Project description, database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff


This database is intended to provide information on guns and gun owners.  With this database, a user can find information as general as gun companies, to information as specific as the gun serial numbers.  The database also provides a way to link specific guns to their owners.  Therefore, this database can be used for more than a single purpose.


Database Engine: Postgres


Potential Users: Police, Gun Enthusiasts, Military
